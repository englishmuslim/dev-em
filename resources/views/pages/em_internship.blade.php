            <p>English Muslim team consists of a team of nearly 100 people who work very passionately to provide better
                access to quality education through the use of technology. We have built a learning management system
                targeted to the K-12 market in Indonesia which enables students and teachers to access learning
                materials for free. In addition to that, we also provide complementary services, such as private
                tutoring and learning video subscription to help students advance their education. We work closely with
                the government and schools to generate data that would help them to develop more evidence based
                education policies.</p>

            <p>We are an ambitious group and we work really hard to pursue our goals. We also realize that to do this,
                we will need help from you - the equally ambitious, hungry, talented, passionate, and hardworking
                individuals to join the team. Our current team boasts people having studied at Stanford, Harvard,
                Columbia, NTU, UI, ITB, Unpad, IPB, and other top universities. Many of them have also worked in a
                diverse set of industries, including consulting, startup, non-profit, education, research, creative, and
                other sectors. We at English Muslim also like to have fun, and we bet you will also get lots of it when

        <div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
            <h4 class="bold">Who can apply?</h4>
            <p>This program is open for students in high school, diploma, undergrad or master programs, as long as you
                have the skills and the drive needed to succeed. Fresh graduates and professionals in their sabbatical
                are also encouraged to apply!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
            <h4 class="bold">What should I prepare for my application?</h4>
            <p>In general, you only have to prepare your most updated resume and portfolio of your past work (for those
                who
                are applying for engineering & design and content lab positions). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
            <h4 class="bold">How is the typical selection process?</h4>
            <p>We will review your application in a few cycles. If we think your profile is interesting, we will invite
                you for an interview session (we don't wait until application period is closed). Our team will interview
                you to discuss about who you are as a person, your interest, past work, aspirations - and how exactly we
                can help you to achieve that! The earlier you apply the better your chances to be accepted. We review
                applications on a rolling basis and will prioritize those who apply early. Since our capacity to
                accommodate interns is limited, we might close the application early if we have filled in the roles. So,
                donâ€™t wait until the last minute!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mt-4">
            <h4 class="bold">Why do I need a portfolio?</h4>
            <p>In our experience, portfolio is a better indicator of a candidate's skillsets. Even, to be frank, if you
                donâ€™t have a good GPA in school, do not worry - you can compensate it with activities or work portfolio
                that reflect your deep passion about what you are doing! :)</p><br />
